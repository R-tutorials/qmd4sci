# Captioning and referencing equations

This section introduces how to add captions to equations, and reference them in text.

## Questions

- How do I caption an equation?
- How do I reference an equation?

### Numbering equations

You can make reference an equation by adding a label starting with `#eq-` after the equation `$$`. For example:

```
$$
Y \sim X\beta_0 + X\beta_1 + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-linear}
```

Gives

$$
Y \sim X\beta_0 + X\beta_1 + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-linear}


You can then refer to the equation in text using `@eq-linear`:

> Our model is given in @eq-linear.

## Other equation-adjacent referencing

You can also use and reference theorems, lemmas, conjectures, and many more - to see these, see the Quarto documentation: [theorems and proofs documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs).
