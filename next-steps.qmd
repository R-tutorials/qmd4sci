# Next Steps

So now you've got a handle on Quarto, what are some of the other things to think about learning? Here are some of my recommendations.

## Learn how to use git and github

git is a version control system. Not sure what a version control system is? No worries, let me explain. If you've ever named a document something like:

```
Final
Final 2
Really final
```

[Relevant PhD comics link](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531)

Or even if you have something like:

- `2018-10-10-document.qmd`
- `2018-10-11-document.qmd`

These are ways of managing which version you have.

To learn git and github, I'd highly recommend [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) by [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/), the [STAT 545 TAs](https://stat545.com/), and [Jim Hester](https://www.jimhester.com/)
